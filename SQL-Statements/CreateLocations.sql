    ,"A"
    ,"Blackthorn Castle"
    ,"A remote and dilapidated castle on the outskirts of the city. Once a historical landmark turned museum, the city discovered it could generate far more income by renting the space out to eccentric supervillains. Its acoustic spires provide ideal stages for maniacal laughter, while the gift shop serves as a perfect front for any money laundering operations. The abysmal wi-fi helps to preserve its integrity as a timeless relic of a simpler time."

    ,"A"
    ,"City Sewers"
    ,"Concealed beneath the city, there are villains which call the web of dimly lit sewers, ferrying waste from pipe to pipe, home. It is a network of narrow passageways, hidden chambers, and horrible smells. They ask that you take your shoes off at the manhole."

    ,"A"
    , "Celadon Cathedral"
    , "At the end of a dirt road leading into Celadon Forest stands a crumbling cathedral. Left to ruin for decades, dappled moonbeams fall through its collapsed spire, illuminating an abandoned organ rusting in the loft. Hikers in the forest have reported an inexplicably fast wi-fi connection, and sub-zero temperatures."
    ,6),
  ( 4
    ,"A"
    ,"Volcano Lair"
    ,"A network of tunnels and rooms carved into the walls of the volcano. Smoky clouds roll across its surface, coating the lair and everybody’s clothes in ash. Magma must be shovelled from the doorstep in the summer. Can get a bit chilly in the winter."
    ,7),
  ( 5
    ,"A"
    ,"Grimm's Gym"
    ,'Bone-chilling bangs and terrifying screams can be heard from outside the gym, striking fear into anyone who would dare enter. An intimidating array of musclebound villains can be found in this gym, dropping weights recklessly and crying out as they go for PBs. The vile fiends can be seen spotting one another, telling their lifter they have "one more" again after they just said "one more" on the last lift. Most arrests at the gym are made when the villains are doing their three sets of villainous poses in the mirror.'

    ,"B"
    , "Skull Shaped Mountain"
    , "A ginormous skull carved out of mountain in a protected nature reserve. This is probably where the good guys live."
    ,7),
  ( 7
    ,"B"
    , "Crimson Desert Oasis"
    , "Masked amidst a sea of mirages, an opulent oasis sits deep within the vast Crimson Desert. Wind swept dunes surround the base, a teal jewel in a bed of red. Near impossible to find without a guide, the only intruders to have breached the compound are the red sands tracked in by villainous boots."
    ,6),
  ( 8 
    ,"B"
    , "Magnus Theatre"
    , "A long deserted independent movie theatre forgotten on the third floor of a slightly less abandoned apartment complex in the middle of the city. In a central location, the building is surrounded by busy streets and dark alleys. A humble love letter to cinema then, a great big projector for PowerPoints detailing villainous schemes now. The sound of explosions from films can still be heard, loud enough to rattle the apartments above and below, at least that's what the apartment manager says is causing it. The tenants don't mind it though, since the building wifi is inexplicably fast."

    ,"B"
    , "Coil Casino"
    , "Hypnotic lights lure penniless prey, promising shaky hands that this bet will be their last, as the monkey's paw curls. Above it all, the stakeholders stand behind velvet curtains woven with missed rents and retirement funds. The villains have a hideout in the back somewhere too. The police have raided the place a number of times, but they always walk past the monologuing villains to instead arrest the greedy investors. The villains hold hope that one day - the police will bring enough cuffs for them, too."
    ,6),
  ( 10
    ,"B"
    , "Freeman Prison"
    , "Once containing the world's most dangerous villains - now run by them. Built on Freeman Island, the facility reached a critical mass when the island was discovered to be more of a peninsula. Investors pulled out, layoffs happened, and the authorities were overthrown. The villains decided to make the prison their headquarters because they enjoyed the irony, and they just renovated solitary confinement."
    ,8),
  ( 11
    ,"C"
    , "Old Observatory"
    , "An old forgotten observatory resting atop a hill on the outskirts of the city. No longer the popular school excursion destination it once was. It’s high position and unique setup offer a great vantage point for villains to spot incoming intruders and meteorites."

  ( 12
    ,"C"
    ,"School Playground"
    ,"A true cesspool of despicable villainy. The scum plaguing this place wedgied one of our own data entry specialists... and it was really embarrassing for them."
    ,3),
  ( 13
    ,"C"
    , "Abandoned Water Park"
    , "Once a beloved water park frequented by children, now the residence of some much more manageable evil supervillains. Countless slides twist together into the sky like colossal springs, folding into one another like a tangled Slinkey capped by a makeshift penthouse of repurposed food trucks. The people cower in fear when the villains descend from their spiral tower, their collective “wee” echoing across the city."
    ,6),

    ,"C"
    , "Pillow Factory"
    , 'The villains residing here strike innocent passers-by with pillows before declaring "pillow fight!" This legally obligates the terrified civillian to combat. The helpless victims are then coerced to play Mario Kart, interrogated for what pizza they want to order, and forced to drink hot chocolate until they are knocked out cold on a high thread count pillow.'

    ,"C"
    , "Harbourside Warehouse"
    , "The scent of the sea fills this abandoned warehouse wedged in a once-bustling industrial port district. Now a hub of criminal activity, this warehouse has become warehome to many aspiring villains. A safe place to keep their hard-earned stolen goods, and to have a smoke where their mums can’t see."
