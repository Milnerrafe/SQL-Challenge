Pyra fires off a burst of flame straight towards Freeze Tag. Freeze Tag's ice melts, and he is left standing in a lukewarm puddle, his powers cancelled out. Hellakinetic grabs a chair from rows of chairs in the cathedral and telekinetically flings it at an astonishing speed towards Prop. Prop morphs into the chair and sends it flying back towards Hellakinetic. The chair crashes into Hellakinetic, sending him flying into a wall and knocking him unconscious. The victorious heroes bring the defeated villains to the time out corner to stay and think about what they’ve done before searching for the bags of stolen money. They find it in the crypt. The heroes bring it back to the bank, and the bank workers are overjoyed. They thank the heroes profusely. The heroes thank them, and take their leave. Congratulations, you’ve solved the mystery!
